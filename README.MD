## DAT505 - Ella Chambers
# Cityscape

This is a three.js VR Project. For this project I created a 3D city using MAYA, and created my own textures through photoshop. I added the model to my three.js code and developed the scene by adding audio, rain particles and a gradient background. The FirstPersonControls allow the user to fly through the city and explore the scene.
